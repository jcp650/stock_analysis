# Stock Analysis with VBA

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to refactor VBA code that analyzes annual stock performance in the green energy sector. Specifically, the refactoring goal is to make the code run faster and more efficiently by combining seperate blocks of code to run in one subroutine. Another refactoring goal is to increase the code's performance capability by running an analysis on multiple stocks simultaneously. Refactoring this code provides a reusable code block that can handle large amounts of stock market data and produce critical information on stock performance for any year with decreased runtime.
